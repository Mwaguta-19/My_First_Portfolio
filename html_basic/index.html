            <h3>My Journey in Web Development at ALX</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, I am learning web development as part of the ALX program. It's an amazing experience, where I am 
                being introduced to essential web development tools and languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program 
                is structured in a way that allows me to learn at my own pace while getting support from fellow learners and mentors.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a beginner, the ALX program provides me with clear goals, hands-on projects, and challenges that help me 
                grasp concepts step-by-step. While it's sometimes difficult, I'm gaining confidence as I progress through the 
                curriculum, and I look forward to building my own projects.
            </p>
